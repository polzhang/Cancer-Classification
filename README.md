# Cancer Classification Task Report

This project was completed as part of the IT1244 course. The goal was to classify cancer vs. healthy samples from an imbalanced dataset, consisting of DNA fragment length frequencies with a 7% healthy class. We used various techniques to address the class imbalance and improve classification accuracy, with the final model combining multiple approaches into an ensemble method. Overall, ensemble methods and class imbalance handling strategies significantly improved the model's performance, achieving the best results in terms of accuracy and recall.
